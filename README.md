This C program represents a simple shell, which provides a command-line interface for users to enter and execute commands. The main function initializes the shell and invokes the prompt function to display a prompt (":)") and wait for user input. The prompt function reads user input, checks for the presence of a pipe symbol ('|') to determine if multiple commands are entered, splits the input into individual command arguments, and then executes these commands using the execute function. The execute function first checks if the entered command is a built-in shell command (e.g., "cd", "help", "exit"), and if so, it handles it accordingly. If not, it launches an external process to execute the specified command. This shell continues to run until the user exits or the executed commands return a non-zero status, indicating an error or termination.
